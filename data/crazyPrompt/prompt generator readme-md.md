# DP Random Crazy Prompt Generator for ComfyUI

A custom node for ComfyUI that generates creative and wild prompts for AI image generation. This node combines different elements to create unique, imaginative, and often humorous prompts.

## Features

- Generates random prompts following a structured format
- Combines elements from 8 different categories
- Adjustable "style craziness" level
- Over 10¹⁹ possible unique combinations
- Perfect for creative and experimental image generation

## Installation

1. Create a folder named `Dp_Random_Crazy_Prompt_Generator` in your ComfyUI custom nodes directory
2. Copy the following files into the folder:
   ```
   Dp_Random_Crazy_Prompt_Generator/
   ├── __init__.py
   ├── dp_crazy_random_prompt_generator.py
   └── data/
       └── crazyPrompt/
           ├── subject.txt
           ├── composition.txt
           ├── lighting.txt
           ├── color_palette.txt
           ├── atmosphere.txt
           ├── technical_details.txt
           ├── additional_elements.txt
           └── styles.txt
   ```
3. Restart ComfyUI

## How It Works

The node generates prompts by combining random elements from the following categories:

1. **Subject**: The main focus of the image (e.g., "a majestic space penguin wearing a tuxedo")
2. **Composition**: How the image is framed or arranged (e.g., "extreme close-up with dramatic perspective")
3. **Lighting**: The lighting effects and conditions (e.g., "rainbow laser beams from multiple directions")
4. **Color Palette**: The overall color scheme (e.g., "neon cotton candy explosion")
5. **Mood/Atmosphere**: The emotional tone (e.g., "chaotically euphoric")
6. **Technical Details**: Camera or rendering specifications (e.g., "shot with a potato camera at maximum resolution")
7. **Additional Elements**: Background or supporting elements (e.g., "floating in a sea of rubber ducks")
8. **Style**: Artistic styles (quantity depends on style_craziness setting)

### Style Craziness Levels

The node includes a "style_craziness" parameter that determines how many artistic styles are combined:

- Level 1: 3 styles
- Level 2: 5 styles
- Level 3: 7 styles
- Level 4: 9 styles
- Level 5: 15 styles

## Example Outputs

Here are some example prompts generated by the node:

```
a quantum physicist cat giving a TED talk, bird's eye view through a kaleidoscope, quantum particle glow, radioactive sunrise spectrum, chaotically euphoric, rendered by a committee of interdimensional cats, amid a tornado of dancing street signs, in the style of cyberpunk, digital art, surrealism

a professional butterfly wrestler in spandex, diagonal split-screen chaos, plasma aurora swirls, cosmic lava lamp swirls, dramatically underwhelming, shot through a lens made of fossilized starlight, surrounded by quantum bubble machines, in the style of steampunk, vaporwave, oil painting, pop art, psychedelic art
```

## Customization

You can customize the available options by editing the text files in the `data/crazyPrompt` directory. Each file contains one option per line. Feel free to add, remove, or modify the options to suit your needs.

## Mathematics of Combinations

With 100 items in each category, the node can generate:
- Level 1 (3 styles): 1.617 × 10¹⁹ different combinations
- Level 2 (5 styles): 7.528 × 10²¹ different combinations
- Level 3 (7 styles): 1.600 × 10²⁴ different combinations
- Level 4 (9 styles): 1.902 × 10²⁶ different combinations
- Level 5 (15 styles): 2.533 × 10³¹ different combinations

This ensures virtually unlimited unique prompt combinations!

## Tips for Best Results

1. Experiment with different style craziness levels
2. Try combining the output with other prompt manipulation nodes
3. Use with different model checkpoints to see varied interpretations
4. Save interesting prompts for future use
5. Use as inspiration for manual prompt crafting
